# Python_Practice
Practice code I have for python

This program, assignment58_GUI26_calculator.py, is one of my code practice in Python. It uses the Python GUI package, tkinter, 
to generate a caculator GUI for the arithmatic operations:

* addition

* subtract

* multiply

* divide

## How to Run it

* install Python in Windows or Linux

* open command window or terminal

* run the command: python assignment58_GUI26_calculator.py, then the calculator GUI will pop up. 

Type in the first number and the second number, click on one button of +, -,*, or -,
 the result will show under the button line.

## Languages and Code Logic
Python 3.x and the Python GUI package, tkinter, are used. It first defines a Tk canvas, labels, entries, window for the input fields ,
then define the functions of getSum(), subtract(), product(), and divide(), which are used as the commands for the corresponding buttons of +, -, *, and /. 

When one button of +, -, *, or / is clicked, the corrsponding function will be called as the callback to get the entry values, do the calculation, and display the results.
